This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion. When adding a number and a string, JavaScript performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous behavior.  The solution in `bugSolution.js` explicitly converts the string to a number before performing the addition, thereby fixing the issue. This is a crucial consideration when dealing with user inputs or data from external sources which might be in unexpected formats.
